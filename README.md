Current Robotics Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania 
concentrating on controls and computer vision. I also have a strong 
interest in machine learning and mechatronic systems. Seeking 
internship for the Summer of 2022 in any of the aforementioned 
concentrations. Previous individual project interests leaned towards 
robotic design, testing, control, simulation, and programming. 
Extensive details of my undergraduate projects can be found on

Previous plastics manufacturing engineer. The workplace included 
the full development of End-of-Arm-Tooling devices, medical devices, 
and test fixtures for tack-welding, quality control testing, part 
assembly, and insert/injection molding for plastics. Here, my team 
and I developed an inspection method to detect and correct 
manufacturing error, reducing part failures from up to 50% down to 
12-15%. We also improved automated manufacturing efficiency and 
reduced overall labor hours.
